# Game Rules
1ยบ Choose a base word with a minimum of 4 letters

2ยบ Try to guess as many words as possible that can be written with the letters of the base word

3ยบ You only have 3 lives! If you write an invalid or non-existent word you loose a life

# Game Example
Base Word: parent

Correct Guesses: part, net, pet, tap

Wrong Guesses: partner (the base word only has 1 letter 'r' and not 2), dog (the base word has none of those letters), tnerap (word doesn't exist)

# Language
The game can be played in both english and portuguese. 

The structure of the web page is the same for the 2 languages but the database for the words is (obviously) different.
